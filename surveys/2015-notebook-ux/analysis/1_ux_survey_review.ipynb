    "# Jupyter UX Survey 2015 - Initial Sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goal: Start looking at how we can surface insights from the data.\n",
    "* Description: https://github.com/jupyter/design/tree/master/surveys/2015-notebook-ux\n",
    "* Data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/surveys/2015-notebook-ux/20160115235816-SurveyExport.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### To what audiences is the Jupyter Community trying to cater?\n",
    "\n",
    "* New to the practice of \"data science\"\n",
    "* Experienced audience not using jupyter\n",
    "* Existing audience\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can we boil down the free text to \"themes\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove stop words and find key terms to do some frequency counts\n",
    "* Read and tag everything manually, then analyze the tags\n",
    "* Overlap between responses to the various questions\n",
    "* Apply coccurence grouping to the text\n",
    "* Throw text at the alchemy Keyword Extraction API and see what it pulls out\n",
    "* Bin short vs long and analyze separately\n",
    "\n",
    "### What roles do the survey respondant fill? And in what fields / industries do they fill those roles?\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Roles]() section down below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generally, what themes do we see across the free-text responses?\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Themes]() in hinderances section for an initial approach on how to find and expand on sets of themes for one particular question. We think we can apply this to the other questions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What themes do we see across the free-text responses but within the role/industry categories?\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g., Is it always software developers that are asking for IDE features vs hard scientists asking for collaboration features?\n",
    "\n",
    "We took an initial approach on rolling up the roles into a smaller set of categories. We then looked at mapping the requests for vim/emacs and ide feature to the software engineering related roles. It turns out that these requests seem to cross roles, and are not specific to software engineers. More of the responses for emacs/vim, in fact, came from respondants from the hard sciences (e.g. physicist, computational biologist, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This led us to believe that we should not assume certain roles are certain hinderances, but rather try to visualize if there are any hot-spots between roles and hinderance themes. It may turn out, we hypothesize, that the roles have little to do with the hinderances and that the themes are cross cutting. Or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to create heatmap-like plots, one per question. On one axis we will have the role categories and on the other we will have the themes we identify within the responses for that question. After creating these plots for all questions, we'll also create similar plots where we substitute industry, years in role, # of notebook consumers, frequency of use, etc. on one of the axes and keep the themes on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What shortcodes can we use to refer to the questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we roll up the answers into single columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* how_often\n",
    "* how_long\n",
    "* hinderance\n",
    "* integrated\n",
    "* how_run\n",
    "* workflow_needs_addressed\n",
    "* workflow_needs_not_addressed\n",
    "* pleasant_aspects\n",
    "* difficult_aspects\n",
    "* features_changes\n",
    "* first_experience_enhancements\n",
    "* keywords\n",
    "* role\n",
    "* years_in_role\n",
    "* industry\n",
    "* notebook_consumers"

      "It's starting to become a regular tool. I run the notebook server on a VPS and use the notebook through SSH. I run the notebook server on code in a Git master branch and I sync that with a local branch periodically. I have mostly just used Idle in the past because that is very flexible and I get a complete transcript of my programming session. But support for Idle and improvements to Idle have mostly stopped. I like the general idea of the notebook but the format doesn't support some things very well - testing for example. I would like to have my tests in a separate notebook that is linked to the one I'm currently developing (same kernel I guess). I would like my tests to be separate because if they are in the same notebook as my normal code then it is distracting. I could migrate out my tests to  a separate file, but then they are not in the same notebook format as the regular code which is very convenient.  Some things in Jupyter are frustrating: 1. the kernel cannot be reliably interrupted. 2. kernel crashes. This means that datasets must be reloaded which can take a long time in my case. 3. code is not reloaded easily: I have to manually use reload(module) if the code is in a file. The notebook should reliably reload modules: I realize that this is a long-standing problem in Python generally that has still not been resolved after all these years. 4. code reload in a cell is very buggy. I've had old code remain in a cell after making a change that has caused some strange results. A reload of the code in a cell should clean out all of the old definitions and variables in that cell so that there can't be any strange behaviour due to old references. \n",

      "Interactive plot exploration (through matplotlib) is a bit clunky and much worse than in Matlab, for example. You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole \"Jupyter package\".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as \"hidden code\" which would be excluded from the generated PDF for example.  The UI is a bit clunky and editing code is a bit painful when there is a lot of code in a cell.  Being able to run cells out of order is cool but it also makes it hard to reproduce what you did later. This makes it particularly hard to turn a notebook into a proper Python script sometimes. It would be great if you could somehow replay the notebook in the order that you executed it and export that in the proper order. Maybe there should be a way to programmatically execute a cell from another cell (maybe this is already possible and Injust don't know about it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Inability to easily navigate within modules/structured code directories, so that I can develop my code simultaneously as a package/module and within a notebook. Prototyping in the notebook is great, but then making sure everything works appropriately when outside of the notebook environment is more difficult without a lot more infrastructure. Furthermore, once it is ported to an external module, its essentially impossible to either bring the code back into the notebook efficiently (i.e., not just copying and pasting into cells) and or to maintain a coherent version control stream for the changes then made in the notebook. So currently software development in a notebook to external module is a 1-way street, and not a particularly easy one to navigate.   Also, inconsistency in relative import statements make developing software packages in a notebook/module. Given the portable nature of the notebook, it's nice to be able to work from the same source files on a variety of computers. But absolute paths can't be used across machines (unless they follow the same convention) and its not clear how one would specify the absolute path relative to the location of the notebook server and vs. notebook itself.  Editing documentation in the notebook (especially with executable examples) would make it easier to jump between source code and explicit documentation. Linking a particular cell out to a particular docstring for a particular function/class/method would be great.\n",

I work in computational quantum physics, and in my \"old\" workflows, e.g., with Fortran codes, the computation and analysis were usually well-separated: The results from (potentially long-running) simulations were saved as text files, and then analyzed/plotted with, e.g., gnuplot.  Jupyter Notebook makes this more convenient by allowing me combine simulation and analysis in a single notebook without the intermediate step of saving text files and reading the data again. However, this also makes it much easier to \"lose\" results that only ever existed as data, but were not written to files. Going back to writing text files for all of the possibly interesting output would be a step back regarding the interactivity, so an easy way to save program state or something similar would be great.

Unexpected scrolling between cells when move cursor/focus or execute a cell (particularly when using Firefox and when have large cells).  Difficult to keep on top of API changes and developments in associated components e.g. widgets; ipython-dev and jupyter mailing lists can help here but useful info tends to get rather buried amongst things pertaining only to dedicated developers (and sysadmins interested in jupyterhub configs).

The integration of matplotlib could be better. E.g. resizing of a graph still does not trigger a redraw, and is not stored for the next run of this code cell.  2. A basic version of shared notebooks would be great. Of course, real time collaboration at one notebook would be best, but running notebooks on different machines, and tracking individual changes would be a great first step, thaat, I think, is much easier to realize, and  almost as helpful.  3. Some lightweight admin level for code cells (run, delete, move cell groups). Probably possible to combine this in a reasonable way with some structure of the notebook.\n",

As code used for data analysis for a single project becomes more stable, i find it better to move the functions that dont require change out of the notebook, for 2 reasons : 1.a : Makes my notebook more clear - i only keep the functions i m still tinkering with 1.b : Protects me against accidental deletion by moving important functions into version controlled .py files. It happenned a few times to lose hours of work in the notebook by abusing the 'cut cell' action. (Cuts a few cell, including a few critical preprocessing ones - codes still runs fine as variables are in memory. Saves notebook. Come back a few days later --> broken)  2. Some weeks i do web dev (to show all those nice plots created in notebook) . Notebook's not useful for this.\n",

Sometimes I'll have a particular or analysis demoed or sketched in a Notebook; simply running the Notebook will be enough to produce the whole result that I care about. Because it's not easy to run Notebooks from terminal (like \"$ python my_notebook.ipynb\"), I end up having to convert them. But since in the process, I end up creating a normal script, I take the time to write a full shell script with argparse and other options in case I want to tweak the output later. That's all fine, but it would be really nice to just by able to run the notebook directly.  Additionally, first-class or native support for git-hooks would be nice, so that it's easier to track a notebook in version control. Really - all I care about is the logic, not the metadata for each cell!\n",

       "1607    Inability to easily navigate within modules/structured code directories, so that I can develop my code simultaneously as a package/module and within a notebook. Prototyping in the notebook is great, but then making sure everything works appropriately when outside of the notebook environment is more difficult without a lot more infrastructure. Furthermore, once it is ported to an external module, its essentially impossible to either bring the code back into the notebook efficiently (i.e., not just copying and pasting into cells) and or to maintain a coherent version control stream for the changes then made in the notebook. So currently software development in a notebook to external module is a 1-way street, and not a particularly easy one to navigate.

When reading code in another IDE, I know the execution order is determined by the visual order in combination with the call graph. In Jupyter Notebook, since a cell below could've been executed before a cell above, the ordering now must include the numbers next to the cells; this is too many elements for me to keep track of.

       "      <td>Interactive plot exploration (through matplotlib) is a bit clunky and much worse than in Matlab, for example. You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole \"Jupyter package\".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as \"hidden code\" which would be excluded from the generated ...</td>\n",

I can edit text files very fast due to all of the support from various text editors but writing notebooks in a primitive GUI requires too many mouse clicks even with the keyboard shortcuts. The UI is missing too many basic features to allow one to create notebooks very fast, like copying/pasting from one notebook to another, etc. The notebook format is also difficult to manage with version control which makes them a pain to see the differences. The fact that both the code that generates the content and the generated content live in the same file is problematic. Separation of content and presentation could be very beneficial.  \n",

As soon as that happens the Notebook workflow loses its optimization. There's only so many \"restart kernel\" operations you can do before it starts to hinder productivity.  While recognizing prompting for OK when restarting the kernel is a reasonable UI decision, I'd LOVE to see a keyboard shortcut that does not prompt so I could get around this slowdown.  \n",

For windows users especially the process is a pain, but stuff like anaconda helps, though it's all very conda-centric which causes added confusion.  Similarly with the system python vs homebrew one in macs. I guess none of this is very ipython specific, but it always comes up during the process of getting ipython + numpy + pandas etc working.  \n",

I find it too cumbersome for that workflow.  I also find the non-relationship between execution ordering and visual ordering off-putting for development. When reading code in another IDE, I know the execution order is determined by the visual order in combination with the call graph. In Jupyter Notebook, since a cell below could've been executed before a cell above, the ordering now must include the numbers next to the cells; this is too many elements for me to keep track of. As a result, I tend to only use Jupyter Notebook for exploratory work (more like a REPL), and copy and paste code into a text editor as I finish with a small snippet.  \n",

       "1239  Interactive plot exploration (through matplotlib) is a bit clunky and much worse than in Matlab, for example. You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole \"Jupyter package\".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as \"hidden code\" which would be excluded from the generated ...  \n",

It's difficult to run an IPython Notebook server that has support for both Py2 and Py3 kernels - ideally, there should be some way to integrate with conda so that you can easily start kernels in any conda environment.  Similarly, I often end up with multiple 'ipython notebook' commands (from the Terminal) running at once, as I want them to be in multiple different directories and in multiple conda environments. Combining this with the previous point: it'd be great if I could have it running as a service (or something similar), and then could just easily create a kernel from any conda environment, and navigate to the right folder - and have it all 'just work' without having to run new servers all the time</td>\n",

       "135   It's not as nice an 'editor' as a 'proper' programmers text editor (such as Emacs, Sublime, Atom etc).  It can be tricky to scroll up and down and deal with large cells with lots of code.  It's difficult to run an IPython Notebook server that has support for both Py2 and Py3 kernels - ideally, there should be some way to integrate with conda so that you can easily start kernels in any conda environment.  Similarly, I often end up with multiple 'ipython notebook' commands (from the Terminal) running at once, as I want them to be in multiple different directories and in multiple conda environments. Combining this with the previous point: it'd be great if I could have it running as a service (or something similar), and then could just easily create a kernel from any conda environment, and navigate to the right folder - and have it all 'just work' without having to run new servers all the time  \n",

It is too mouse-driven. I'm a bit embarrassed to complain, because I should just build an emacs-layer myself. Presumably there'd be a vim-layer available too.  2. Does not play nice with version control. I prefer to keep my source separate from my results, and it's difficult to get Jupyter to do this. If nbconvert could run the same \"Clear All\" command that you can run by clicking in the notebook, dumping the clear-all'ed to stdout, I think I'd be golden.  \n",

Typically, the notebook has some quick ideas in it, which inevitably don't follow the best coding practices. So I often need to replace things, or edit all instances of a variable, etc - something that is hard (if not impossible) in the notebook.

When reading code in another IDE, I know the execution order is determined by the visual order in combination with the call graph. In Jupyter Notebook, since a cell below could've been executed before a cell above, the ordering now must include the numbers next to the cells; this is too many elements for me to keep track of.

       "814   I don't use it for multi-file development (where I am working on both Python modules imported from another file, and the file that imports them). I find it too cumbersome for that workflow.  I also find the non-relationship between execution ordering and visual ordering off-putting for development. When reading code in another IDE, I know the execution order is determined by the visual order in combination with the call graph. In Jupyter Notebook, since a cell below could've been executed before a cell above, the ordering now must include the numbers next to the cells; this is too many elements for me to keep track of. As a result, I tend to only use Jupyter Notebook for exploratory work (more like a REPL), and copy and paste code into a text editor as I finish with a small snippet.  \n",
