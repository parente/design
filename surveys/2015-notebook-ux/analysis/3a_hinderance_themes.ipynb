I understand this may not really be the point of jupyter nootbooks, but I find myself cutting code, pasting to a text editor, and pasting back in all the time. In my limited experience (could easily be wrong about this), it doesn't have great integration with virtualenv, so it's a bit of a headache to switch from one env to another and reconfigure jupyter. On the nitpick side, translation of magic commands to equivalent python commands would be amazing when exporting to a .py file. \n",

Matplotlib is designed as a copy of matlab, the output is in image format, and within the notebook, optimised for display. Interactivity with the visualisation is not great, and small tweaks take an inordinate ammount of time. Producing visual outputs for purposes outside of the notebook is also cumbersome.   \n",

It seems designed to be a single document rather than an complete interface. If you think about other powerful and ubiquitous software platforms, like Adobe Illustrator or Matlab, they often are designed around panels that expose useful information or interaction.  For example, an editor, variable browser, command line, etc.  I wish there were also multiple views within the Jupyter Notebook.   \n",
