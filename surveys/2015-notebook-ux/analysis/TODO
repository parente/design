# TODO

* Finish last question each (separate)
* Extend the existing question breakdown notebooks to save off their themes in CSV / DataFrame (pair)
* Notebook that categorizes the job roles and spits out a CSV / DataFrame of them for reuse (jtyberg)
* Notebook that sets up a factor plot of: (parente)
  * theme / keywords overall
  * theme / keywords by job category
  * theme / keywords by how often used
  * theme / keywords by how long used
  * hypothesis: "it ain't gonna matter", the distribution is going to be the same shape across them all

  * Also have very simple frequency count plots for the other questions
