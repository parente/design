# TODO

* Notebook that categorizes the job roles and spits out a CSV / DataFrame of them for reuse
* Notebook that sets up a factor plot of:
  * theme / keywords overall
  * theme / keywords by job category
  * theme / keywords by how often used
  * theme / keywords by how long used
  * hypothesis: "it ain't gonna matter", the distribution is going to be the same shape across them all
* Extend the existing question breakdown notebooks to save off their themes in CSV / DataFrame
* Turn the factor plot notebook into a final rollup notebook with the factor plot per free text question
  * Also have very simple frequency count plots for the other questions
